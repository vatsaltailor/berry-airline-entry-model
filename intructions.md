Please perform a static entry game estimation for the airline industry based on the data Download dataprovided. The data includes the entry decision of 2,742 markets, where a market is defined based on an origin-destination pair. The data includes information about the entry decision of six airline companies. The associated market-level control variable information is also appended.

Note that the market fundamentals of your Berry estimation should include:

Origin city controls: population size, whether the city is for tourism
Destination city controls: population size, whether the city is for tourism
Route-level controls (for an origin-destination pair): distance, passenger
Please also include an additional airline-level control that indicates the size of the airline company:

airlineaa = 1,000; airlinedl = 1,500; airlineua = 1,000; airlineal = 1,500; airlinelcc = 500; airlinewn = 500.
Please upload your code and include your final estimates of the three parameters. You might leverage the sample R code at
